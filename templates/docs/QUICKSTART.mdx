# Getting Started

The Connector-SDK is primarily for DataLbry internal usage, nevertheless we are releasing the SDK with Open-Source licenses, so others can use it for their very own Connectors, or write new Connectors for the DataLbry Knowledge Cloud.

## Quickstart

1. Add the plugin to your `build.gradle.kts`

```kotlin
plugins {
    id("io.datalbry.connector.sdk") version "$projectVersion"
}
```

2. Add the following snippet to your `settings.gradle.kts`
```kotlin
pluginManagement {
    repositories {
        gradlePluginPortal()
        mavenCentral()
        google()
    }
    resolutionStrategy {
        eachPlugin {
            if (requested.id.id == "io.datalbry.connector.sdk") {
                useModule("io.datalbry.connector:connector-sdk-plugin:$projectVersion")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Plugin
The Connector-SDK provides a convenience plugin for JVM based builds. 
We developed the Connector-SDK Gradle Plugin to help developer easily bootstrap the setup process of the connector repository.

### Configuration

The Connector-SDK-Plugin is using a properties first approach for configuration.
It will search in the following locations for configurations (the first one will be used)

1. Gradle Properties
2. Extensions

## Connector

### Properties
The Connector SDK requires various configurations to be set while installing.

| Property | Required | Example| Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *io.datalbry.connector.alxndria.datasource* | Yes | a736c224-aa4d-457b-ae7f-2bb9b890d17d | - | The Alxndria datasource to use for synchronization. There must always be a 1:1 relationship between Connector and Datasource. |
| *io.datalbry.connector.alxndria.uri* | Yes | alxndria.datalbry.io | - | The URI to the Alxndria instance. |
| *io.datalbry.connector.concurrency* | No | 2 | 1 | The Concurrency level of the Connector. 2 will result into having two parallel worker per connector instance. |
| *spring.datasource.url* | Yes | jdbc:postgresql://host:port/database | - | The Postgres database to store the traversal information in |
| *spring.datasource.username* | Yes | admin | - | The user to authenticate to the database with |
| *spring.datasource.password* | Yes | admin123 | - | The password to authenticate to the database with |
| *spring.rabbitmq.host* | Yes | 168.24.24.0 | - | The host of the RabbitMQ broker |
| *spring.rabbitmq.port* | Yes | 5672 | - | The port of the RabbitMQ broker |
| *spring.rabbitmq.username* | Yes | rabbit-user | - | The user to authenticate with to the RabbitMQ broker with |
| *spring.rabbitmq.password* | Yes | secret | - | The password to authenticate with to the RabbitMQ broker with |

## Limitations
* The Connector-SDK only supports `Kotlin`, as we heavily rely on compiler plugins, which are not yet being developed for java
