# Concepts

## Preamble
This document is meant to describe the core-concepts of the Connector-SDK.
It might be complicated by the first glimpse, but if you are familiar with graph-algorithms,
it will be rather easy to understand.

## Graph
Most systems can easily be described with a graph of information,
some nodes in the graph are simply there to point to other nodes,
while other nodes are simply there to describe a specific resource.

Is rather abstract in the very first moment, but gets clearer with an example.

:::tip
We want to integrate the data from Slack into the Knowledge Cloud.
Therefore, we are analysing the information graph within Slack.

There is an object called **Chat**, which is directly related to **n** different user.
The chat also contains any arbitrary amount of messages.
Each message can contain a limited amount of attachments.

For our information graph we are following exactly the described path.
First we have a node **Chat** with a unique identifier, linking to all **n** user plus all messages.
While each and every message will also have a unique identifier plus a reference to its attachments.

### Nodes

Nodes are parts of the system, containing information of the system, such as:
1. References (`Edges`) to other `Nodes`
2. Information of `Document`s

### Edges
Edges are parts of the system, describing the information necessary to access another node of the source.
In most parts its sufficient to describe the resource which should be accessed using the edge, as well as the identifier.

For Atlassian Confluence a valid edge might contain the following information: `Type:Space`, `Id:DEV`.
These two information are already sufficient to describe the `Space` named `Dev`.

The information which have to be provided in edges heavily varies from system to system and from
connector implementation to implementation.

### Documents
Documents are a specific type of Node containing information about a single entity in the source system.
Each and every Document is described by at least it's primary key,
which has to be unique for the whole source graph.
Documents are described by metadata, plus their content.

### Container
Container are also a specific type of Node, but in contrast to Documents container only provide information of Edges
Container are especially useful when there are Nodes without much metadata, and which might not be useful to integrate as a Document.

## Modes

The Connector-SDK currently supports a single mode: **Content Traversal**.
There are more planned for the future.
Such as **Principal Traversal**, which will traverse the security information of the system.

### Content Traversal
A content traversal is a simple traversal of the whole system,
starting at the very root and traversing the whole graph.

## Parallelization

The Connector-SDK is able to parallelize the processing of nodes.
While the integration cycle is being single threaded for each node,
there might be multiple cycles running at a time,
each on a different node of the source system.

:::info
To parallelize set the property *io.datalbry.connector.concurrency* to 2 or more.
We highly recommend not using a value greater than 10.
Negative values, as well as the value 0 are unsupported.

## Integration Cycle

The Connector-SDK itself is a state-ful application, requiring to persist the current structure of the knowledge graph.
Whenever running a subsequent traversal, the Connector will continuously check for deleted nodes within the graph.
Deleted nodes can simply be a Page which has been deleted within e.g. Atlassian Confluence,
or sometimes a whole Space which will result into deleting all its documents.

The integration cycle refers to a single node.
The Connector-SDK parallelize running integration cycles on multiple nodes at once.

The cycle runs the following steps

1. Detection: Searching for references to new nodes
2. Propagate References: Propagate the new references to the message broker
3. Propagate Documents: Propagate the documents to the target system
4. Calculate Deletions: Deletions are being calculated in simply running a diff between the current and last run of the specific node
